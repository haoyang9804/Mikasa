# What is Mikasa?

Mikasa is planned to be a header-only, metaprogramming-oriented, drop-in framework for code contests.

Currently, the project is in the development phase, and my primary focus is on completing the implementation of frequently used data structures.

To validate Mikasa's accuracy and functionality, I am utilizing it to address online coding problems.
You can find my passed codes under `test` folder and learn how to use Mikasa from them.
